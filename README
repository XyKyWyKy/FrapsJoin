FrapsJoin: append Fraps AVI segments by generating an AviSynth script
Requirements:
	Fraps (http://www.fraps.com/)
	AviSynth (http://avisynth.org/)

Fraps is a program that captures Windows gameplay as AVI video files. For reasons
of backward compatibility, the video files are limited to 4 GB in size, so a long
recording will consist of many 4 GB movies that must be joined with a video editor.
This is a source of annoyance for many people and has widely been regarded as a
bad move.

This little script attempts to mitigate the situation by joining the movies quickly
and easily. It does this using Avisynth. Avisynth is a frameserver that can process
video sources in various ways and make available a 'virtual' video source. You open
the FrapsJoin-generated Avisynth script in any video editor that supports AviSynth
as a video source.

INSTALL:
   1) copy the FrapsJoin project files to any location, eg "C:\Program Files (x86)\FrapsJoin"

   2) in Windows Explorer, right-click the script, "Copy"

   3) in the Explorer navigation bar, type "shell:sendto", Enter

   4) right-click, "Paste Shortcut"

   5) review the "FrapsJoin.ini" file for script tweaking (optional)

USAGE:
   1) Capture some video with Fraps...

   2) Go to the capture folder in Windows Explorer

   3) Sort files by Date (all files in a 'sequence' will have the same Modified Date)

   4) Select Fraps files from the 'sequence' you want to work with

   5) Right-click, 'Send To', 'FrapsJoin.vbs' (or whatever the shortcut is named)
        Script sorts the files by name and joins all files with an Avisynth script
        Avisynth script has same name as first file in sequence,
        except starts with an optional prefix and has an 'avs' extension

   NOTE: you can also drag the files to a shortcut on the Desktop etc

   6) Open the new script in any application that supports Avisynth:
        VirtualDub, WinFF, StaxRip, XMedia, etc

   NOTE: all files must be same resolution and frame rate or they won't join
