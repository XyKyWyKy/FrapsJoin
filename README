FrapsJoin: rename Fraps videos grouped by recording
	http://github.com/XyKyWyKy/FrapsJoin
Requirements:
    Fraps (http://www.fraps.com/)

Fraps is a program that captures Windows gameplay as AVI video files. For reasons
of backward compatibility, the video files are limited to 4 GB in size, so a long
recording will consist of many 4 GB movies that must be joined with a video editor.
This is a source of annoyance for many people and has widely been regarded as a
bad move.

This little script attempts to mitigate the situation by renaming the videos,
grouped by recording. All files which represent a continuous recording are given a
common name, followed by a 3-digit serial number. The files can then be joined
automatically by VirtualDub, and possibly other video editors.

FrapsJoin can also generate *scripts* for three different applications: Avidemux,
Avisynth and Virtualdub. In addition, you can write your own postprocessing commands:

 * using Avisynth, you can do color correction, resizing etc;

 * using Virtualdub, you can do that too, plus you can set compression
   settings and save the final video if you wish. You can run the script
   using VirtualDub's command line interface (vdub.exe).

Review the included INI file and samples for help & more options.

INSTALL:
   Copy the FrapsJoin project files to any location, eg,
   "<My Documents>\FrapsJoin". Then choose one or more
   of the following ways to use the script:

   * SEND TO mode installation: right-click the script, "Copy";
     in the Explorer navigation bar, type "shell:sendto", Enter;
     right-click in the Send To folder, "Paste Shortcut"

     To launch, right-click any AVI file in your Fraps folder,
     select "Send To", FrapsJoin

   * DRAG AND DROP MODE installation: right-click the script, "Copy";
     right-click on the Desktop, "Paste Shortcut"

     To launch, drag any AVI file in your Fraps folder to the
     FrapsJoin shortcut

   * To launch in OPEN WITH mode, right click any AVI file,
     "Open With...", browse to FrapsJoin.bat; 'FrapsJoin' should be
     retained in your "Open With" menu for future use.

USAGE:
   * Capture some video with Fraps...

   * Go to the capture folder in Windows Explorer

   * Launch FrapsJoin using one of the three ways described above;
     for each group of videos you will be prompted for a 'group name';
     hit Enter to accept the default (default = first file name)

   * Open the first file (suffix "-00") in VirtualDub; then use File menu,
     "Append Avi Segment...", select the next file in the group (suffix "-01"),
     and check "Autodetect additional segments"; VirtualDub does the rest.
